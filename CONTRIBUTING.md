# Contributing & Submission Guidelines

- Work on your fork and open PRs to `main`.
- Branch naming: `submit/{github-username}/week-XX` or `attendance/{github-username}`.
- PR title format: `[Week XX] {github-username} â€” {short title}`
- Keep sensitive data out of the repo (no real credentials).
- Use templates in `templates/` for consistent submissions.
- Mentors will review and merge after feedback.

If you need an exception for deadlines, contact mentors via the designated communication channel (Discord/Slack).
