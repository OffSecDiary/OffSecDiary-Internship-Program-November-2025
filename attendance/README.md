# Attendance â€” process & format

Attendance is recorded per participant as a single markdown file: `attendance/{github-username}.md`. Participants must open a Pull Request that adds/updates their file.

File format (example):
- Name: Full Name
- GitHub: @github-username
- Email: optional@domain
- Attendance:
  - week-01: class-wise screenshots
  - week-02: class-wise screenshots
  - ...
- Notes: optional

Example file: `attendance/johndoe.md`

Rules:
- Keep your attendance file truthful.
- If absent, add a short reason & proof (if required).
- Mentors will validate and may mark excused/adjust attendance before merging.
